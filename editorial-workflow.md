# Editorial Workflow for Buddhist Concepts Website

This document outlines the process for creating, reviewing, updating, and publishing content on the Buddhist Concepts website. The goal is to ensure accuracy, consistency, quality, and adherence to the site's style guide.

## Workflow Stages

1.  **Proposal/Assignment**:
    *   New content ideas can be proposed or assigned based on the `plan-tracking-v2.md`.
    *   Priority is given to tasks outlined in the current implementation phase.
    *   Assignee confirms understanding of the topic and requirements.

2.  **Drafting**:
    *   Author drafts the content following the `style-guide.md` and relevant `content-templates/`.
    *   Focus on accuracy, clarity, appropriate language level, and proper citations.
    *   Include necessary visual elements (diagrams, images) placeholders if not creating them directly.
    *   Self-review against the style guide and accuracy checklist before submission.

3.  **Peer Review**:
    *   Draft is submitted for review by at least one other team member or designated reviewer.
    *   Reviewer checks for:
        *   Adherence to `style-guide.md`.
        *   Accuracy of information and citations.
        *   Clarity, grammar, and spelling.
        *   Logical flow and structure.
        *   Appropriate tone and language level.
    *   Feedback is provided constructively, referencing specific style guide points.

4.  **Fact-Checking/Expert Review**:
    *   For core doctrinal content or complex topics, review by a subject matter expert (e.g., qualified Buddhist teacher or scholar) is required.
    *   Expert verifies doctrinal accuracy, interpretation nuances, and correctness of Pali/Sanskrit terms and translations.
    *   Fact-checker verifies all specific claims, dates, and external references.

5.  **Revision**:
    *   Author incorporates feedback from peer and expert reviews.
    *   Clarifications are sought if feedback is unclear.
    *   Revised draft is potentially resubmitted for a final check if major changes were made.

6.  **Visual Asset Creation/Integration**:
    *   If diagrams, infographics, or specific images are needed, they are created or sourced following `design-system.md` (once created).
    *   Assets are optimized for web and integrated into the content with proper alt text.

7.  **Final Edit/Proofreading**:
    *   A final editor proofreads the content for any remaining errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, formatting, and link validity.
    *   Ensures consistency with the overall site style.

8.  **Publication**:
    *   Content is merged into the main branch/build system.
    *   Published content is checked live on the site for rendering issues.

9.  **Post-Publication Review & Update**:
    *   Content is periodically reviewed (e.g., annually or based on user feedback) for accuracy and relevance.
    *   Updates follow a condensed version of this workflow (Draft -> Review -> Publish).
    *   User feedback suggesting corrections or improvements is reviewed and actioned via this workflow.

*   **Author**: Creates the initial draft.
*   **Peer Reviewer**: Provides feedback on style, clarity, and basic accuracy.
