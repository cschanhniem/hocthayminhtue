# Intermediate 3-Month Meditation Program

This program is designed for practitioners who have established a basic meditation practice and are ready to deepen their experience. It builds on foundational skills and introduces more nuanced techniques and teachings from the Buddhist tradition.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this program, you should:
- Have maintained a regular meditation practice for at least 2-3 months
- Be comfortable sitting for 20-30 minutes at a time
- Have basic familiarity with breath meditation and body awareness
- Completed the [Beginner's 8-Week Program](/content/beginners-meditation-program/) or equivalent experience

## Program Structure

This program is organized into three months, each with a specific theme:
1. **Month 1: Deepening Concentration (Samādhi)**
2. **Month 2: Cultivating Insight (Vipassanā)**
3. **Month 3: Opening the Heart (Brahmavihāras)**

Each month includes:
- Weekly practice instructions
- Daily formal sitting practice (30-45 minutes recommended)
- Supplementary practices for daily life
- Suggested readings and reflections
- A day of practice (mini-retreat) at the end of each month

## Month 1: Deepening Concentration (Samādhi)

### Overview
This month focuses on developing stronger concentration through sustained attention on meditation objects. You'll work with the breath in more refined ways and learn to recognize and cultivate jhānic factors (qualities of meditative absorption).

### Week 1: Stabilizing Attention

**Daily Practice (30-40 minutes)**
1. Begin with 5 minutes of settling and connecting with your intention
2. For 20-25 minutes, practice breath meditation with these refinements:
   - Find where the breath sensations are most clear and pleasant
   - Stay with that specific area throughout the session
   - When attention wanders, gently but firmly return to the breath
   - Count breaths in cycles of 10 if it helps maintain attention
3. For the final 5-10 minutes, open awareness to include the whole body
4. Close with a brief reflection on what you noticed about attention

**Daily Life Practice**
- Practice "coming back" to breath awareness at least 10 times throughout the day
- Notice what pulls your attention away most frequently
- Set reminders on your phone or associate practice with routine activities

**Reflection Questions**
- What conditions help your mind settle more easily?
- What do you notice about the quality of attention at different times?
- How does the breath change as your attention stabilizes?

### Week 2: Working with the Five Hindrances

**Daily Practice (30-40 minutes)**
1. Begin with 5 minutes of breath awareness
2. For 20-25 minutes, continue breath meditation while working skillfully with hindrances:
   - When desire arises, notice its feeling tone and effects on the body
   - When aversion appears, recognize it without getting caught in its story
   - When dullness occurs, brighten attention or shift posture slightly
   - When restlessness is present, give it space while maintaining anchor
   - When doubt arises, simply note "doubting" and return to practice
3. Close with 5-10 minutes of open awareness
4. End by acknowledging your effort regardless of how the session felt

**Daily Life Practice**
- Notice which of the five hindrances appears most often in daily life
- Practice naming hindrances when they arise outside of meditation
- Experiment with antidotes: gratitude for desire, loving-kindness for aversion, etc.

**Reflection Questions**
- Which hindrance is most challenging for you?
- What strategies help you work with each hindrance?
- How does recognizing a hindrance change your relationship to it?

### Week 3: Cultivating the Jhānic Factors

   - Joy (pīti): Notice and appreciate pleasant qualities that arise
   - Happiness (sukha): Allow feelings of contentment to develop

3. Close with 5-10 minutes of open awareness
4. End by dedicating the benefits of your practice to all beings

## Month 2: Cultivating Insight (Vipassanā)

4. End by reflecting on the changing nature of experience

**Daily Life Practice**

### Week 4: The Three Characteristics Together

**Daily Practice (40-45 minutes)**
